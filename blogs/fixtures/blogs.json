Create a sense of community: Building and maintaining strong relationships with students, parents, and colleagues goes a long way. We are lucky to work with highly committed support staff who are willing to be trained and follow through with expectations, and this is crucial. Collaboration on shared expectations is invaluable.\r\n\r\nWe start by getting to know students’ interests, strengths, and needs—not only from the IEP, but through interest inventories and conversations with students, parents, and previous teachers. We also reach out to families early on and continuously throughout the year, inviting and welcoming parent feedback. And we share students’ successes, not just their challenges or concerns.\r\n\r\nWe collaborate with other teachers across disciplines to make our program more inclusive. For example, we work with English, history, and science teachers to connect ideas such as the sequencing of events like geological events. We connect that to the sequencing of events in a story, and use a timeline like they do in history class. We have also collaborated with the art classes to have students make a model of the life sequence of a star or layers of rock when we study those concepts.\r\n\r\nWe also work to connect our students to their peers through our peer mentorship program, where students can earn credits for serving as buddies for our students. Peer mentors are assigned to a self-contained class, assist students with activities within the class, accompany them on community-based trips, eat lunch with them, and lead extracurricular events including dances, game nights, and other events, all of which foster a sense of belonging and community.\r\n\r\n2. Establish routines, but encourage flexibility: When students are taught the importance of routines and also how to be flexible in certain situations, they are more prepared for life after school.\r\n\r\nWe divide our class periods into learning blocks. This allows for structured movement while opening up the idea of being flexible in learning material in different ways. We also encourage flexibility by offering students choice and differentiation in learning.\r\n\r\nWe start each day with a check-in. This routine helps us gain perspective about each and every student in the room and allows us to gauge students’ level of energy, focus, and readiness to learn. We end class with an exit ticket. It doesn’t have to be about what they have learned—sometimes it’s a simple statement on how each student feels after a lesson or activity.\r\n\r\nProviding choices for students is important—allowing them to show their understanding of a concept through creating a game, drawing a picture, completing a worksheet, or discussing it within a group helps improve their engagement with content. We also revisit and practice important content and skills daily; reinforcing the skills within a subject such as mathematics helps students build working memory.\r\n\r\n3. Employ varied instructional approaches: Varying instructional approaches in the classroom offers opportunities for students to learn in different ways and helps keep their engagement level up.\r\n\r\nWe integrate learning stations often to encourage physical movement, opportunities to differentiate, and exploration of concepts through different mediums. We also like to provide opportunities for the students to teach and create—when they attempt to teach concepts, they gain a better understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nVarying instructional materials is another way to boost engagement, and we frequently switch between hands-on activities, computer apps, and lab and data collection activities. We also try to make learning fun by setting up games and fun activities with tools like Kahoot and Quizlet to reinforce skills while keeping things enjoyable.", "image_url": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593642632823-8f785ba67e45?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDF8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1489&q=80"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 16, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Teachers—on Making Room for the New Kids in Class", "author_friendly": "Paige Tutt", "description": "More than 6.5 million K–12 students in the U.S. change schools during the academic year.

The constant state of flux can make both more established and newly arrived students feel anxious or distracted, Secrest said. Moreover, students who move a lot struggle with trust and feeling a sense of belonging—the building blocks of productive academic environments.\r\n\r\nAt Burning Tree Elementary School in Bethesda, Maryland, the school organizes activities (virtual during the pandemic) for new and existing families to connect, such as a virtual bingo event, virtual trivia night, and various virtual scavenger hunts with differing monthly themes.

What’s the schedule? Are we doing remote, hybrid, or in-person school this week? For some of us, the way school looks has changed frequently this year, to the point where our heads are spinning. Our routines, schedules, ways of teaching lessons, and expectations—of both our students and ourselves—are in a constant state of flux; any day can feel like the first day of school, over and over again. This can be particularly challenging for those of us who teach young children, who thrive on consistent structure and routines.\r\n\r\nThe day will come when all teachers return to the classroom for hybrid or full in-person learning. If you are one of the many early childhood teachers taking first steps back into the classroom after teaching remotely, you may be wondering how you will establish routines, set up norms, and strive to create a community mid-year.\r\n\r\nHELPFUL STRATEGIES\r\nMake safety protocols fun: Mask wearing, maintaining distance, and hand washing are important in keeping all of us safe at school. When you use kid-friendly language to set the tone and explain these safety protocols, young children can feel more comfortable following the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffer flexible seating: It can be a challenge for young children to spend a lot of time in an assigned spot. Flexible seating gives them choice in what is most comfortable for them and goes a long way in making a classroom feel more inviting. Bouncy balls, wiggle seats, yoga mats, small rockers, and seating cushions at low tables are all options for making a classroom feel more inviting for your students. Space out sit spots around the room with as much distance as possible between to help create the physical distance needed in the classroom.\r\n\r\nProvide individual storage tubs: Children need access to work materials and things to play with, but a shared tub of Legos that draws children together can’t be used right now. Instead, create individual storage boxes so that children can keep all their work materials for the day neatly organized, as well as individual “take and go” play boxes filled with items like Legos, watercolors, puzzles, and pretend animals.\r\n\r\nThe children can bring these tubs to their work space, so choice time can still happen, even if it’s socially distanced. They’ll still be able to work, play, and talk to each other safely.\r\n\r\nUse a long rope for moving as a group: Physical distancing is not an easy concept for young children to understand—they naturally want to run and be close together. When moving from one space to another at school, or while taking walks outside, use a rope with tape holds spaced six feet apart to teach children what a safe distance looks and feels like. Children can hold on to their spot on the rope when moving as a class. This safe, distanced way of moving can be your class train where all are invited to come aboard.\r\n\r\nCreate a peaceful learning environment: When children return to the classroom for the first time, they will likely experience many emotions. Many of them have not been to school for a very long time. Some younger kids will never have been to a physical school, and some will have experienced severe loss and anxiety. Have calming music or nature soundscapes on when children enter the room in the morning; that sets the tone for a calm day of learning and lets children know that school is a welcoming, peaceful place where they can learn and be with their friends. Play lively songs or soothing meditations during transitions to help keep kids moving, centered, and feeling joyful throughout the day.\r\n\r\nFocus on social and emotional connection: In the midst of a pandemic, it’s hard for some students to focus on academics. Reach out to each child and meet them where they are emotionally, whether that’s excited and ready to jump right in or hesitant or even fearful. Building connections among children can ease them back into in-person learning and help them feel safe at school. A class mascot can help with this. Every day, my morning meeting features an appearance by our turtle stuffie, Twiggles, who has been with the class all year, including during remote learning.\r\n\r\nEach morning Twiggles asks the kids, “How are you feeling?” The kids talk to Twiggles, and he listens to their answers, and sometimes he asks them funny questions that make the kids laugh, like “I’m a turtle and I’ve never been out to play in the snow before. What should I wear?” In conversation with Twiggles, each child feels valued and heard. We also get to laugh together again, which helps everyone to feel better.\r\n\r\nLower your expectations: All those curriculum projects and activities you’ve done in the past are not going to happen the same way this year, no matter how hard you try. Everything is a bit more challenging, particularly when it can be difficult to hear kids when they’re talking with their masks on, and when small group work isn’t possible because of social distancing.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to acknowledge this dramatic shift and lower the expectations you’ve had of what school should look like. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that this year we are all trying our best with what we have. We are constantly discovering new ways to accomplish as much as we can with the children this year, and the rest can wait. You are doing the best you can, and that’s enough.\r\n\r\nGet outdoors: There are many benefits to teaching outdoors, including easing of anxiety. Even in the middle of a cold winter day, a short outdoor activity like a snack or read-aloud or playtime can go a long way in building community, resilience, and excitement for being back at school. Time outdoors offers a welcome relief from students’ assigned indoor work spots, and it can give them a chance to take off their masks (at a distance) to take a deep breath of fresh air.", "image_url": "https://media.edutopia.org/styles/responsive_1400px_original/s3/masters/2021-02/2E3FAE0-crop.jpg"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 18, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "5 Ways to Give Students a Makerspace Experience at Home", "author_friendly": "Megan Jacobs", "description": "Hands-on projects that use inexpensive materials and focus on multiple iterations help make learning fun.", "date": "2021-02-28T14:20:39.148Z", "article": "As districts reel to meet the evolving needs of their communities beset by a pandemic, the loss of experiential, maker-centered learning seems inevitable. Teachers in remote or hybrid settings face a real challenge, made all the more urgent by the need for students to engage in tactile learning away from ubiquitous screens. But there are strategies you can use to help your students bring a bit of maker culture home.\r\n\r\n5 STRATEGIES FOR OFFERING HANDS-ON PROJECTS REMOTELY\r\n1. Integrate choice. Student-centric learning design has always heavily featured student choice, and it’s the right time to lean into it even more. Choice grants focused autonomy to students, affording them a sense of control in uncertain times. It also makes a positive result more achievable. We can’t possibly imagine and plan for all the hurdles in each student’s home, and offering a more open-ended process or product can give students the leeway and the license to navigate their environments successfully. Choice has the added benefit of allowing your students to exercise and appreciate multiple modalities and intelligences.\r\n\r\nWhen my third graders began learning about forces in motion, I gave them the option to design a real physical “golf” course using any ball and whatever building blocks they might have had available (recyclables, Lego Duplos, wooden blocks, or even furniture). Those without the materials, or who were learning at a house that wasn’t their own, were invited to use a digital simulation of tug-of-war from PhET, a product of the University of Colorado Boulder that provides free, interactive math and science simulations. Everyone learned in ways that were meaningful and accessible to them, and their end-of-lesson discussion was much richer due to the varied and diverse experiences of their peers.\r\n\r\n2. Keep it accessible by using what they likely already have. Being cognizant of what materials you request and making an effort to avoid those that are expensive, out of the ordinary, or both can help all students to find your remote projects accessible. In a climate where pennies are counted more carefully and extra trips out of the home are avoided, don’t add to the problem by requiring items that aren’t likely to be in the home already. It’s a great time for reusing recyclables and making things that are easy to deconstruct, without having ruined the materials that went into them.\r\n\r\nWhen my third graders tested out centripetal force, I had them tie any kind of string (ribbon, twine, fishing line, yarn, even a shoelace) around any kind of small soft thing (cotton ball, stuffed animal). I used a single tissue in my example. No matter what they used, they were able to fling it around in a circle to demonstrate centripetal force and then take it apart and still have perfectly usable materials. When I require drippy glue, I include a recipe for a DIY, make-from-home-with-common-ingredients option.\r\n\r\n3. Offer pickup for materials, as many districts have done for classroom materials. Many districts have a procedure in place for materials to be picked up weekly or as needed by parents or families, often in conjunction with free meal pickup. Consider this option for oddball materials that would be high impact for your instruction, especially those that could be considered consumable, like plastic pipettes. Include instructions for care, and accept news of loss or damage with grace.\r\n\r\n4. Capitalize on parent/family participation. For some families, a silver lining of remote and hybrid learning is the increased participation of parents and family members. Parents who might not have their finger on the pulse of the science, technology, engineering, and math classroom in more normal times now have the opportunity to cheer on their children, share advice or encouragement, and even lend a hand. Think about giving an option for your project to be completed with help from family members, especially in younger grades. Create a platform for parents to share praise or report something they’ve learned from their child. Not all home environments are positive, and not all adults can give this time; be cognizant of this and show grace. Give room in your grading systems.\r\n\r\nAround Thanksgiving, my second graders made shelters for Pilgrims out of recyclables and tested them out against high winds (a hair dryer or fan) and snow (cotton balls, marshmallows, etc.). Families were welcome to pitch in, and I had so many who enjoyed working together.\r\n\r\n5. Celebrate iterations. One of the most important parts of a makerspace classroom, and one of the most painfully absent in our current climate, is an opportunity for iterative learning. Having the opportunity to start something, try it out, make adjustments, and try again is central to the idea of the student as the maker, and it’s really hard to do today. I recommend swapping our focus from the product to the process. Design a very flexible project, and have the students’ main task be to document their design changes. Set up a scavenger hunt, and require them to report one item they fixed, one thing that worked well from the outset, and one thing they scrapped entirely. Or, have the final product actually be a collaged layout of pictures of their progress, showing how their thinking evolved.\r\n\r\nIt’s so valuable to steer our classrooms back toward the pillars of experiential learning that we value so much. By offering learning opportunities that capitalize on maker-centered tenets, we take important steps to fill these voids.", "image_url": "https://media.edutopia.org/styles/responsive_1400px_original/s3/masters/2021-02/iStock-920738486-crop.jpg"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 19, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Virtual Coaching Takes Off", "author_friendly": "Kimberly Blumke", "description": "When video is at the core of instructional coaching, the entire process becomes more efficient and effective.", "date": "2021-02-28T14:22:04.181Z", "article": "As a literacy coach working in a rural area with 10 school districts spread out over 2,000 square miles, I’ve long been accustomed to providing professional learning to educators through large, face-to-face group sessions and small professional learning communities, and virtually using Zoom. But given the geographic area I need to cover, with approximately 100 K–3 teachers, and as I am my organization’s only literacy coach, even before the pandemic the one-on-one instructional coaching that is often seen as a gold standard was limited.\r\nVIDEO AS THE CORNERSTONE\r\nCoaches and athletes have used video to improve for years, to the point where reviewing footage of plays is core to training. I’ve found that when teachers watch a recording of themselves teaching, they often see things differently than when they are in the moment. Providing teachers the opportunity to see their teaching and student learning in action is powerful; add collaboration with a coach to that experience and it becomes even more so.\r\n\r\nWhen I have teachers view themselves teaching a lesson, I ask them to make time-stamped reflective comments to share with me. A coaching platform we use called Sibme makes this process super-simple (it allows teachers to record, upload, edit, annotate, and share video), but video can be taken with any device, and comments can be shared with timestamps in Google Docs too. The coach can then view the recording and the teacher’s reflections. I respond with my own time-stamped comments.\r\n\r\nThe same approach works for coaching conversations. I ask teachers for permission to record our sessions so I can review the recordings and increase my own effectiveness through self-reflection. Additionally, another coach and I often share our recordings with each other, so the process mirrors what we do with teachers: We share our recordings, reflect, and offer feedback. Just as with teachers, the reality of what I see in the recording doesn’t always match the perception I had at the moment.\r\n\r\nGiven the demands of those circumstances, I got creative. I spent countless hours reading various resources and creating structures and protocols for a virtual coaching program; that foundational work served me well once the pandemic hit and it became imperative that we roll out virtual coaching in order to coach safely and to support teachers through the incredible instructional pivot they faced.\r\n\r\nIn fall 2020, we hit the ground running with a virtual coaching program that is robust and effective and, importantly, provides the flexibility that teachers need. This approach has entirely changed the way I do my work. Here’s a distillation of what I’ve learned.", "image_url": "https://media.edutopia.org/styles/responsive_1400px_original/s3/masters/2021-02/AMERICANED_MIDDLETOWN_182-crop.jpg"}}]
