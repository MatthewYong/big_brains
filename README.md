## UX
To understand what the result of the website needs to be, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the developer’s objective and the user needs (goals).

#### User Stories
As a **user** I want to:
1.  Buy toys
2.	Be informed of latest toys
3.	Contact the website owner
4.	Pay safely
5.	Check my purchase history
6.	Register my profile
7.	Login to my profile

As a **developer** I want to:
1.  Gain more knowledge on Django
2.	Create a full-stack framework
3.	Learn more on databases, such as MySQL

As an **admin** I want to:

1.	Add products/services
2.	Manage products/services
3.	Remove users
4.	Check user’s purchase history


### Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include on the website.
This will be further explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Navigation menu | 1. Edit review|
|2. Banner | 2. Add toys as admin through website instead through Django portal|
|3. Landing page|
|4. Toy view & detail pages |
|5. Blog view, add & edit pages |
|6. Cart & Checkout pages |
|7. Login & registration pages |
|8. Profile page |
|9. Add toy review |

### Structure Plane

The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user. 

#### Interaction Design
The following definitions has been used for this website:
- First impression of the website needs to be as simple and clear as possible
- No more than three clicks are required for the user to reach the page
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the ‘Hierarchical Tree’, see below:

#### Information architecture

This project has 4 collections in the database. The database structure in MongoDB has been set up as follows:

### Skeleton Plane
The skeleton plane defines a basic visual design of the website through, for example, a wireframe.  
The wireframes for this project are made with Balsamiq can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Wireframe - Desktop version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/
- [Wireframe - Tablet version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/
- [Wireframe - Mobile version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/

Below you can find an example of a wireframe of the landing page.

### Surface Plane
The surface plane defines the appearance of the website. This website needs to attract and encourage users to focus on the website's content.
The following design style has been used:

| Design Style | Design Choice|
| :------------- | :---------- |
Font: Open Sans | A font with an improved readability|
Text colour: #0F0F0 | A dark color|
Background colour: #FFFF| To enhance text and images |
