## UX
To understand what the result of the website needs to be, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the developer’s objective and the user needs (goals).

#### User Stories


### Scope Plane

### Structure Plane



#### Interaction Design


#### Information architecture


### Skeleton Plane


### Surface Plane


## Features


### Existing Features


### Features Left to Implement


## Technologies Used

## Testing


## Deployment
